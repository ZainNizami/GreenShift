GreenShift Inspiration

Gentrification often brings rapid urban development—but it can also displace long-standing communities and increase carbon emissions through construction, infrastructure strain, and loss of green spaces. We asked ourselves: "What if we could quantify the sustainability of gentrification?"

Inspired by the intersection of climate justice and urban equity, we created GreenShift, a tool to help identify which neighborhoods are at risk of unsustainable gentrification—so that policymakers, developers, and communities can make smarter, more just decisions.


What GreenShift Does

GreenShift calculates a Sustainability Score for Toronto neighborhoods based on four key indicators:

🌱 Green Score — % of green space per area

🏘️ Affordability Score — rent increases relative to median income

🏗️ Permit Score — concentration of building permits as a proxy for development pressure

✅ Completeness Score — data availability/coverage for reliability

The higher the score, the more sustainable and resilient the neighborhood is—lower scores indicate areas at risk for carbon-intensive and inequitable development.

We also classify neighborhoods into risk levels—High, Moderate, or Low—based on their sustainability score.
