GreenShift Inspiration

Gentrification often brings rapid urban development—but it can also displace long-standing communities and increase carbon emissions through construction, infrastructure strain, and loss of green spaces. We asked ourselves: "What if we could quantify the sustainability of gentrification?"

Inspired by the intersection of climate justice and urban equity, we created GreenShift, a tool to help identify which neighborhoods are at risk of unsustainable gentrification—so that policymakers, developers, and communities can make smarter, more just decisions.
